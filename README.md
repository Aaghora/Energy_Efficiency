Problem Statement:
```
```
The effect of eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof
area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution) on two output
variables, namely heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL), of residential buildings is
investigated using a statistical machine learning framework. We have to use a number
of classical and non-parametric statistical analytic tools to carefully analyse the strength
of each input variable's correlation with each of the output variables in order to discover
the most strongly associated input variables. We need to estimate HL and CL, we can
compare a traditional linear regression approach to a sophisticated state-of-the-art
nonlinear non-parametric method, random forests.

The dataset contains eight attributes (or features, denoted by X1...X8) and two responses
(or outcomes, denoted by y1 and y2).
```
```
git (enter) #To check if git is installed
```
```
git remote -v #to see which git is connected to current project
```
``` 
git log  #To see the commits and also the main branch pointing to which head
```
```git remote remove origin #to is connect the current git connected
```
```git remote add origin <repository link> #to change git origin to your repository

git reset -soft <> #to change the main

git add . #add every file newly created or updated

```
git status # checks the status of files
```
```git commit -m "message" #to finalise the changes sent
```
```git push origin main -f #forcefully pushing changes to git hub because history is not same for commit
